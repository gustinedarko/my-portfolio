        <h1><span>About</span> Me</h1>

        <p>I'm a passionate designer and aspiring frontend web developer with a growing skill set in both creative and technical fields. My journey began with graphic design, where I focused on creating bold, clean, and memorable logos that bring brand ideas to life. Over time, my curiosity about how design meets functionality led me to explore web development. I'm currently enrolled in a frontend web development training program, where I've already built and hosted my first website and continue to grow my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. With each project, I aim to blend design aesthetics with user-friendly functionality. I'm excited to keep learning, building, and turning ideas into digital experiences that matter.</p>
